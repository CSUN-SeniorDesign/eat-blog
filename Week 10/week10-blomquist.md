# Amazon CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that is directly connected to the AWS Infrastructure which makes it compatible with other AWS services. CloudFront offer services such as caching and DDoS protection which helps their users to be more cost-effective by downloading content faster and more secure to/from their websites.

### Pricing
The Free tier that AWS offer includes 2 million HTTP and HTTPS Requests and 50GB data transfer out each month for the first year. Once the first year has expired users will have to pay for the services that they use (pay-as-you-go) and prices will vary depending on which region that is being used.

### Edge locations
Amazon want to be close to their users so that they can download content faster. They do that by the use of a large network of edge locations that automatically routes your requests to the closest edge location. Amazon have 127 edge locations spread out all over the world so that they can get closer to their users.
