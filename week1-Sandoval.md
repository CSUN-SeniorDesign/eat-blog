## Brian's Blog Week 1

###### Organization

In terms of organization, in aws I am using an education account that I used in a previous class.
I was able to renew the credits back to a full 100 dollars so it should not be an issue in terms of funding on my end, my team took in the liberty to set up the vpc and configure the subnets to some extent.
Since I was transferred from a previous group I did not have any input in the early stages but was able to start putting input from where the team had left off which was installing an instance.
###### EC2 Instance

Furthermore, my team members were able to create  an ubuntu 16 instance that we will use as our web server.
Logging in to the instance was a bit tricky since we had to use the key and the given pem key could not be used in putty so we had to convert it to ppk format to ssh into the instance since at the time we were using windows OS to connect.
Once inside the Ec2 instance I installed Apache and finished the default setup, we currently have access to our default web page when we visit our site.
###### HUGO

Additionally I have installed Hugo onto the instance and will end up installing Hugo as well to a local virtual machine so that by next week we can start transferring the the html files that will be hosting our blog.
Throughout the weekend I will take the initiative to configure Hugo and start working on setting up a new site and choosing a theme on my local machine.
###### Future Plans

Come Tuesday I will touch base with Eric, Alex, and Tyler to see where we go and I will help to install the TLS certificate after the domain and route53 has been taken cared of. We want to finish as soon as Wednesday the latest so that we can be able to make sure that everything is running how we want it to.
