#Week 1 blog
## Initial Phases
Our course started with an introduction to what we will be working
on this semester and how to achieve those goals. There is a big focus on
collaboration, not just within our group but also with Comp Sci students.
We swiftly formed a group consisting of myself, Tyler K and Erik B. Our 4th
member was MIA for a while but we ended up with a new edition, Brian.
We were happy to have additional help!
All of us quickly got to work creating user accounts and familiarizing ourselves
with the various websites that we will be using. Slack, AWS Educate, and GitHub,
as well as other sites for domain registration and key generation. I purchased
a domain. We split the sections of the project up to divide and conquer but we
ended up working together to overcome obstacles and seek clarification from the
professor on a few snag points.

###Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Cloud
I didn't setup my accounts for AWS properly at first but after submitting a
ticket, credit has been applied to my account and Amazon says all is good,
we shall see. More importantly, AWS is a very impressive and robust cloud
platform. Tyler started setting up the VPC and networking requirements which we
fine tuned in class. Erik worked on getting the instance up and running in EC2.
We chose Ubuntu Server. I think we all learned a lot about AWS through the
process. I registered the domain, then Erik and I pointed records to AWS DNS
servers, and started working on route 53. The website
is online, yet our blog.domain is not functioning. We believe it needs to be
setup as a subdomain.

#### What is left for project 0
Although we have made great progress, we still have a few things to finish. I
believe Brian is working on the Hugo portion. I may need to alter our records
and or settings on namecheap our domain provider for our subdomain.
We still have to finalize the SSL/TLS certificates. We still have to deploy
our blog and wrap up the remaining deliverables and consolidate our work
into a presentation. I hope to have this done by Tuesday but Wednesday is
more likely.
