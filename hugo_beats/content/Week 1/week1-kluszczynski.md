## Tyler's Blog. Week 1
#### What's new this week?

###### AWS Issues
Week 1, we formed groups, created github, slack and AWS accounts. Some of our team members have had trouble receiving their
$100 credit from AWS. Alex and Erik set up their AWS accounts incorrectly so we will have to wait for their credits to come in later. Brian's account has already used some of the credits in a previous class. The credits from my account have been applied already.

###### Organization Issues
We created an organization, but I could only add 1 additional member to it. I contacted support to increase the limit, and it was raised to 10 after about 24 hours. After the limit was increased I all 4 members to it. The organization is under my account name. Each member has a login account for the organization. Only the account that created the organization has billing rights.

###### AWS VPC
The VPC, route tables, and elastic IPs were set up. I set up the subnetting using an online subnet calculator, basing our VPC in Oregon to allow for 3 "regions" for our subnets.  

###### EC2 Instance
An EC2 instance was initialized on Thursday on the VPC. We are using Ubuntu 16 LTS. As of now, the EC2 is only being ran when we are contributing to it, in an attempt to conserve our free hosting hours.

###### Weekend and Next Week's Plans
This weekend we plan to get Hugo working, and Route 53 set up with the domain Alex purchased. Certbot has been installed on the server and is ready to get our TLS certificates once Route 53 is finished.

Next week, we plan to finish everything by around Wednesday, allowing for an additional day just to focus on the deliverables
