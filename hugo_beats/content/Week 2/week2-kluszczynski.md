## Tyler's Blog. Week 2
#### What's new this week?

###### Getting ready for project "1".
We split our team into 2 smaller groups, one focusing on Ansible (Erik and Alex), and one focusing on Terraform (me and Brian). There are a few advantages and a few drawbacks with this plan.

First, it will allow us to balance the workload more easily. It will also allow us to specialize more on one part of the assignment, and hopefully allow us to finish faster.

The problem is, if one part of the assignment requires more knowledge or work (e.g. 3/4th the project is Ansible, and only 1/4th is Terraform), one person will have to transition from working on Ansible to Terraform. Also, if someone is sick or can't work in our group, the other person on the sub-team will have to do all of the work by themselves. If everyone was to learn everything, we could all pick up the slack instead.

Regardless, I plan to look over Terraform to get at least a beginner understanding over the weekend, before the next project is assigned. I believe the rest of the group is planning on doing the same. I also believe that splitting us into 2 different smaller groups is a good idea, but we will see once Project 1 is assigned.

###### Project 0 presentations.
We finished our presentations on project 0 as of Thursday this week. It took us around 2 days to prepare, but I feel that my part was done well, and as a whole, we did fairly well on the it. It seemed to last just over 15 minutes, so the length was good. I believe our presentation also had the most visuals, compared to others (i.e. more pictures).

###### Finishing up Project 0.
I managed to get an SSL certificate set up for blog.fa480.club, www.fa480.club and fa480.club. The blog site took longer however, because the Route 53 setup was giving us problems. As a result, I helped Alex set up the DNS on namecheap and Route 53 on AWS.

I also completed the AWS service diagram deliverable, using 2 different iterations. I also created documentation of how to write a blog (for our team), that Erik updated and added markdown to, so it could be uploaded as a deliverable. Lastly, I updated the README.md's for both project repos.

###### What I want us to improve on.
Overall, I believe we did fairly well on Project 0, but there are some things we need to improve on. The main issue was branching on Github, as that is something we didn't do until the 2nd week blog posts (what you're reading now). Although, we did do issue tracking.

Also, work for the project wasn't distributed in an organized way, and we all worked on what we thought needed to be done as issues came up. For the next project, we will allocate specific tasks to each group member, and plan the entire project out during the first couple days.
