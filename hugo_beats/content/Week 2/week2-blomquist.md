## Erik's Blog. Week #2

##### What have we done?
We got our VPC, Domain, and EC2 webserver up and running last week so we have
been focusing on Hugo and the Documentation portion of project 0 this week.
We started by installing Hugo locally and downloaded themes from their
website which was surprisingly easy. After that we just added our blog-posts.md
files into the hugo project, zipped it, unpacked it onto the webserver and poff,
website live. It was the first time for me working with static website
generators and I find it interesting that you can literally create a website
from scratch and deploy it with just a few commands.

I have had little experience with markdown language, but I am now more
comfortable with it after doing the “How to write a blog” and
“How to deploy a blog” for the documentation part of the project.
Documentations are important and is something that I need to work on.

We also had our presentation this week and I could have done so much better.
I tend to freak out and skip things when talking in front of an audience.
I do not know the reason behind, if it is because English is not my first
language, or if I am not prepared enough. No matter what, presentations in this
class will be a good practice for me.

##### What is next?
Instructions for the coming project has not been posted yet so we have decided
to spend our time on Hugo to develop our site further by changing: how the blog
posts appear, the date of it, etc. We even talked about picking a whole new
theme. We have also agreed to get familiar with Ansible (Me and Alex) and
Terraform (Tyler and Brian) so we divided ourselves into two groups so that we
are better prepared for Project 1.
