At the end of this week I was able to install the s3 bucket through a terraform script. Initially I had to read on what an s3 bucket was since I had no idea, I came to learn that it is a great tool so that people can lock each IAM users configurations that when they apply changes to their scripts it wont create multiple copies of what has already been configured such as having another vpc that is not needed.</h2>

We have been working better as a team and it has been easier to divide things among us.

Each team member is assigned their own set of tasks to work on. Here are my issues: * Terraform - IAM * Improving GitHub instructions * Terraform - Load Balancers * Terraform - Route 53

We got a new addition to the team and decided to delegate Ansible tasks to him. Luckily, last week I learned a lot about Terraform by writing and testing code for the NAT/Bastion and blog server instances. I also reviewed a lot of different example code, from Terraforms website which is very helpful especially with regards to modifying code with arguments.</h2>

Learning about Ansible Much like a bash script allows a user to run several commands at once, Ansible allows an administrator to apply several changes to a server or group of servers at once. This is done with a list of commands that’s consolidated into a yml file called a playbook.
Bash Script vs Ansible Playbook Here is a simple bash script: apt-get install apache2 apt-get install git  Wow the Bash Script looks really short right?</h2>
