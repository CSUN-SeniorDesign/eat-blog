There is a big focus on collaboration, not just within our group but also with Comp Sci students. We swiftly formed a group consisting of myself, Tyler K and Erik B. Our 4th member was MIA for a while but we ended up with a new edition, Brian.</h2>

I was able to renew the credits back to a full 100 dollars so it should not be an issue in terms of funding on my end, my team took in the liberty to set up the vpc and configure the subnets to some extent. Since I was transferred from a previous group I did not have any input in the early stages but was able to start putting input from where the team had left off which was installing an instance.</h2>

We all came into this class with different backgrounds and experiences but we have managed to get a good start on the project and our team work.
What have we done? We have been getting familiar with GitHub, markdown, how to handle repositories, issues, pull requests etc.</h2>

Some of our team members have had trouble receiving their $100 credit from AWS. Alex and Erik set up their AWS accounts incorrectly so we will have to wait for their credits to come in later. Brian’s account has already used some of the credits in a previous class.</h2>

I continued to tinker with Route 53 for the setup of our subdomain: blog.fa480.com. I was certain that the hosted zones in AWS were configured properly. We have one zone for the apex domain and one for the subdomain. I reviewed the hosted zones along with some tutorials from Amazon specifying how to set up a subdomain.</h2>

Setting up route 53 took a bit more work then usual that Tyler had to work on it Monday in setting up the DNS records which took a good amount of work.</h2>

We got our VPC, Domain, and EC2 webserver up and running last week so we have been focusing on Hugo and the Documentation portion of project 0 this week. We started by installing Hugo locally and downloaded themes from their website which was surprisingly easy. After that we just added our blog-posts.md files into the hugo project, zipped it, unpacked it onto the webserver and poff, website live.</h2>

First, it will allow us to balance the workload more easily. It will also allow us to specialize more on one part of the assignment, and hopefully allow us to finish faster.</h2>

Below are the tasks which I have been assigned or am also helping with: Terraform Service Infrastructure - EC2 (Nat Instance) I found terraform code examples that deploy an instance. With some minor modifications I have deployed a new instance to AWS that will act as the NAT and or bastion host.</h2>
