<h2 id="brian-s-blog-week-2">Brian&rsquo;s Blog Week 2</h2>

<h4 id="the-run-down-this-week">The run down this week.</h4>

<h5 id="route-53">Route 53</h5>

<p>Early within the week Alex and Erik took the lead to setting up our route 53 so that we could be able to access our server on the internet through the domain that the team had purchased. Setting up route 53 took  a bit more work then usual that Tyler had to work on it Monday in setting up the DNS records which took a good amount of work.</p>

<h5 id="apache-markdown-format">Apache &amp; Markdown Format</h5>

<p>I had initiated the installation of Hugo on our EC2 ubuntu instance. I ended up making sure that a default web page was showing when we would connect to our local host address. I had a bit of an issue getting used to markdown format and it took me a bit of time to get used to the format as did my other team members.</p>

<h5 id="hugo">HUGO</h5>

<p>Erik and myself were given the task to setup the Hugo server and be able to present a blog page. I initially started the process on testing the Hugo server on a local ubuntu virtual machine that was running ubuntu. Next, after installing it through snap I was able to setup a quick site through the quick start directions that I found in the Hugo site forums. After the site had been setup I wanted to play around with some of the theme templates that were already available from the Hugo site. I went to the configure.toml file  to install one of the themes which was as simple as including the name of it within the given theme category. Erik took to installing Hugo on our EC2 instance he was able to recreate the same steps onto the instance and was able to add further on top of it by being able to use our git repository of our week 1 blog and attach it to our blog web page.</p>
