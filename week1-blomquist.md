# Erik's Blog. Week #1
We started of the week by forming the team EAT that consist of the members Alex, Bryan, Tyler, and Myself.  We all came into this class with different backgrounds and experiences but we have managed to get a good start on the project and our team work.

### What have we done?
We have been getting familiar with GitHub, markdown, how to handle repositories, issues, pull requests etc. All of our members have created accounts and joined our organization so that we can work on the project together. We also created accounts for Slack and GroupMe so that we can reach each other at all times. We created accounts for AWS and AWS educate but I made the mistake of selecting the starter pack for the educate account, so I am waiting for support to get back to me so I can have my $100 AWS credits added to the team (I WILL FOLLOW DIRECTIONS NEXT TIME!).

We have also started to work on the project itself. Alex purchased the http://www.fa480.club domain from namecheap and I have been working with him to setup Route 53. We got the apex and www domains to work but are having issues with the blog.fa480.club domain. Tyler did setup the VPC with proper subnets and route tables and Bryan has been working on the webserver on EC2 that uses Ubuntu 16 LTS.



### What is next?
We have plans to complete the setup of Route 53 so that the blog domain work, to setup and deploy the website with Hugo, and to generate TLS certificates over the weekend/early next week so that we have extra time to work on the group presentation. We are also going to spend time on the documentation part for our infrastructure repository so it is easy to understand.
