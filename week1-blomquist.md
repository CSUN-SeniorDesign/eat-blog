# Erik's Blog. Week #1
We started of the week by forming the team EAT that consist of the members Alex, Bryan, Tyler, and Myself.  We all come into this class with different backgrounds and experiences, but we have managed to get a good start on the project and our team work.

### What have we done?
All of our members have created accounts for GitHub and joined our organization so that we can work on the project together. We also created accounts for Slack, AWS and AWS educate, I made the mistake of selecting the starter pack for the educate account, so I am waiting for support to get back to me with my AWS credits (I WILL FOLLOW DIRECTIONS NEXT TIME!).

We have also started to work on the project itself. Alex purchased the www.fa480.club domain from namecheap and I have been working with him to setup Route 53. Tyler did setup the VPC with proper subnets and route tables and Bryan has been working on the webserver on EC2 that uses Ubuntu.

### What is next?
We have plans to complete the setup of Route 53 so that the blog domain work, setup and deploy blog, and to generate TLS certificates over the weekend/early next week so that we have extra time to work on the group presentation.
