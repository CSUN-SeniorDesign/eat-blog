## Tyler's Blog. Week 2
#### What's new this week?

###### Getting ready for project "1".
We split our team into 2 smaller groups, one focusing on Ansible (Erik and Alex), and one focusing on Terraform (me and Brian). There are a few advantages and a few drawbacks with this plan.

First, it will allow us to balance the workload more easily. It will also allow us to specialize more on one part of the assignment, to allow us to hopefully finish faster.

The problem is, if one part of the assignment requires more knowledge or work (i.e. 3/4th the project is Ansible), one person will have to move over to focus on the other part of the project. Also, if someone is sick or can't work in our group, the other person on the sub-team will have to do all of the work by themselves.

Regardless, I plan to look over Terraform to get at least a beginner understanding over the weekend, before the next project is assigned. I believe the rest of the group is planning on doing the same.

###### Project 0 presentations.
We finished our presentations on project 0 as of Thursday this week. It took us around 2 days to prepare, but I feel that my part was done well, and as a whole, we did fairly well on the first presentation. It seemed to last just over 15 minutes, so the length was good. I believed our presentation also had the most visuals, compared to others (i.e. more pictures).

###### Finishing up Project 0.
I managed to get an SSL certificate set up for blog.fa480.club, www.fa480.club and fa480.club. The blog site took longer however, because the route53 was giving us problems.  As a result, I helped Alex set up route 53 on namecheap.

I also completed the aws service diagram deliverable, using 2 different iterations. I also created documentation of how to write a blog (for our team), that Erik updated and added markdown to, so it could be uploaded as a deliverable. Lastly, I updated the README.md's for both project repos.
